# NWT
This repository is dedicated to the NWT integrated project. 

Please run the script _sourceFEE.R_ to run the analysis for the following manuscript:

_Micheletti et al., in review. Teasing apart the pathways of climate change effects on boreal landbird distributions in Northwestern Canada using SpaDES. Frontier in Ecology and Evolution._

Data will be downloaded, unzipped and placed in the paths determined in the first script. Please note that a very large amount of data needs to be downloaded in this process. Also, there are proprietary data that might need data sharing agreement. These data will fail when trying to download if you don't have access to it.

Please contact me (tati.micheletti@gmail.com) if you need access to any of the proprietary data.
