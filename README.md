# NWT
This repo is dedicated to the NWT integrate project from ECCC/BAM. As it has proprietary data, it is a private repo.

Please, use this repo to upload all code related to the project here:
* SpaDES modules: Should be inside the folder `modules`. Remember that to create a SpaDES module, you can easily install and update the `SpaDES` library and use the command: newModule("moduleName", path/to/folder) 
* Random or temporary codes: Place these codes in the `temp`folder. Please, keep in mind that once the project is over, we should be able to remove these files without a problem.
* Common functions: For now, each module should have a copy of commonly used functions inside the folder `R`

Please, feel free to edit this file if you feel like. :)
