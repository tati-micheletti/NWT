# Steps for fireSense
# 0. Prepare the formula and layers (the same for all three components): need for SpreadFit and will be useful later for the WB project
# ==> This should be a module, and named `fireSense_DataPrep`
# 1. Try to run IgnitionFitted + EscapeFitted (objects from Fit modules) with SpreadFit
# 2. Try to run 1 + predict of all
# 3. Try to run IgnitionFit, EscapeFit, SpreadFit + predicts
# 4. Try to run 3 + SizeFit + SizePredict
